# Work Day Scheduler
This is a scheduler that shows time-blocks of a regular 9-5 work day.

You can include whatever task you need to do in any of the time-blocks, and after you press save,
it will save that information to the local storage. That way, even if you refresh, or come back to the 
page later, your information will still be available.

Time-blocks are color-coded to make it visually easier to tell if they are past (grey),present (green), or future (red) time slots.

Once you save your to-do task, you will get a notification stating that the information
has been saved.
